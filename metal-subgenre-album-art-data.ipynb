A few reasons why Spotify was used instead of a more specialist website (e.g. metal-archives):\n","\n","* Ease of use - Spotify has a good API, and there is a really useful Python wrapper for it.\n","* Because we're searching by biggest bands, there is an inherent notability filter so bands who released 1 EP and were never seen again. They probably also have the resources to hire a proper artist for their artwork, so there'll be less... \"noise\" in the dataset. Caveat here being something like black metal where the lo-fi aesthetic is something we do want to pick up on.\n","* Could be replicated for other kinds of music. Is there a difference in the art direction of different subgenres of jazz? Between different subgenres (and eras!) of rap?\n","* A specialist website is more likely to split hairs over crossovers between subgenres. For the purposes of this exercise (and personally, in general), we don't really care that Blind Guardian are influenced by bay-area thrash (and are at danger of being labelled as \"Thrash/Power Metal\") or that the use of orchestras would classify Fleshgod Apocalypse as Symphonic Death Metal -- we only want a few data classes to work with! _(Edit: Actually found the opposite problem to be an issue - e.g. classic rock being classed as power metal)_"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"0d290a7e","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-07-06T15:37:46.537271Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-07-06T15:37:46.536734Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-07-06T15:38:20.222034Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-07-06T15:38:20.220537Z"},"papermill":{"duration":33.696665,"end_time":"2023-07-06T15:38:20.224978","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-07-06T15:37:46.528313","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Collecting wget\r\n","  Downloading wget-3.2.zip (10 kB)\r\n","  Preparing metadata (setup.py) ... \u001b[?25l-\b \b\\\b \bdone\r\n","\u001b[?25hBuilding wheels for collected packages: wget\r\n","  Building wheel for wget (setup.py) ... \u001b[?25l-\b \b\\\b \b|\b \bdone\r\n","\u001b[?25h  Created wheel for wget: filename=wget-3.2-py3-none-any.whl size=9675 sha256=6b63f66d68875bbeb3b7cc2f3c33ad4b1609ebbcc3be11f750793422fcb46649\r\n","  Stored in directory: /root/.cache/pip/wheels/8b/f1/7f/5c94f0a7a505ca1c81cd1d9208ae2064675d97582078e6c769\r\n","Successfully built wget\r\n","Installing collected packages: wget\r\n","Successfully installed wget-3.2\r\n","\u001b[33mWARNING: Running pip as the 'root' user can result in broken permissions and conflicting behaviour with the system package manager.
