A few reasons why Wikipedia was used instead of a more specialist website (e.g. metal-archives):\n","\n","* Ease of use - Wikipedia has a good API, so it makes sense to do so.\n","* Because of the nature of Wikipedia moderation, there is an inherent notability filter so bands who released 1 EP and were never seen again. They probably also have the resources to hire a proper artist for their artwork, so there'll be less... \"noise\" in the dataset. Caveat here being something like black metal where the lo-fi aesthetic is something we do want to pick up on.\n","* Could be replicated for other kinds of music. Is there a difference in the art direction of different subgenres of jazz? Between different subgenres (and eras!) of rap?\n","* A specialist website is more likely to split hairs over crossovers between subgenres.
